Hello Miho!
<br>
We first met on Oct 26, 2025 in a flight from Osaka. For some reason, you have always been a sweet memory in my heart, and I want to talk a bit about it.
<br>
Before that, I need to apologize to you for this very sudden, unexpected, and seemingly random confession from a stranger you just met once, which you might not even remember anymore. I am only wishing for you the best and most wonderful life.
<br>
This was my first trip to Japan. I started in Tokyo, went to Shikoku, and lastly in Osaka, all in about 10 days. It was such an amazing experience for me, in so many aspects. However, only one reached the ultimate depths.
